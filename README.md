# Bo
**Bo** is a flavour of the MediaWiki [Chameleon skin](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Chameleon) built upon:

- [Stragula](https://github.com/SemanticMediaWiki/Stragula), which it built upon:
- [Bootswatch](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch/) for Bootstrap.

This theme was specially crafted for [Amereida](http://www.amereida.cl) and later for [Casiopea](http://wiki.ead.pucv.cl), which have separate layouts.

## Using Bo

To use this flavour on your wiki you will have to install the [MediaWiki Chameleon skin](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Skin:Chameleon) first, move in this repo to the "skin" directory of your wiki and add the code as stated in the [documentation](/LocalSettings.md/) to your "LocalSettings.php" file.
